# Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML-in-R

![](Predictive_Analytics.jpg)

## Introduction
This is a GRIP task analysis that requires use of python to carry out prediction using Supervised ML of the given data. In this task, A prediction of the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 

## Problem Statement 
The aim of this analysis is to answer the following business related questions:
- Predict the percentage of students based on the no. of study hours?
- What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25hrs/day?

## Methodology:
- Loading the data
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizing the data
- Splitting, modelling and training the data
- Conclusion

## Skills, Concept & Library used:
- ggplot2
- caret
- modelling
- statistical analysis
- visualization
- data manipulation
- critical thinking

# Loading the Data

The data was viewed after loading it in R using the view(df) code

# Exploring the Data

Furthermore, statistical analysis was carried out on the target variable.

![](missing_value.jpg)

The above checks for missing values in the data set and we can see that all data are complete without any missing values

# Visualizing the Data

The above visual gives understanding of how normally distributed the target variable is. We notice a slight skewness to the right.

The above visual shows us the relationship between the target variable and associate variable. This clearly shows a linear relationship meaning as the hours of reading increases, the scores increase.

# Training, Testing & Modelling

The above shows the data was splitted into 80% train and 20% test.

The model was trained using the above code and the variables were defined to point to the new trained data set and not the untrained dataset.

Finally, the model was evaluated. This is very key as it allows us to assesss how well the model is likely to generalize new unseen data. The 3 metrics used for evaluation of model peformance are Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Error. It is important to note that the yard stick used for measurement depends on context of the problem, size of the dataset and variability of the data. In this case, having a mean absolute error of 3.7841 seems reasonable as when compared to the range of data in the target variable (that is between 0 and 100). In general, the lower the values of the 3 metrics, the better the performance but keep in mind this varies from the type of analysis you carry out.
## Conclusion 
The predicted Score if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day is approximately 93.33%.
